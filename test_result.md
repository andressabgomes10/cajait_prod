Only issue found: Mobile menu toggle has a JavaScript logic problem where the menu doesn't open properly on mobile devices. The hamburger button is visible and clickable, but the menu display remains 'none'. This is a minor UI issue that doesn't affect core functionality. Contact form successfully processes submissions and shows success messages. All external links and visual elements work as expected."
